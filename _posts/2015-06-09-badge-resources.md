If you need help in order to issue badges for the Learn and Earn program, please contact the City of Learning help at [info@cityoflearning.org](mailto:info@cityoflearning.org)</a>.

In general, the plan is that individual providers can keep a spreadsheet record of what students have completed the curriculum (and earned the 3 curriculum badges). They can then share this up with one of the primary badge issuing organizations who will issue badges as coming from the "Learn and Earn Collaborative."

Digital Badges are part of the City of Learning. To learn more about the City of Learning initiative, go to the website at [pghcityoflearning.org](http://pghcityoflearning.org)

If you are interested in joining the City of Learning campaign, creating your own badges and listing your educational programs to the public, fill out the [City of Learning Partner Form](http://pghcityoflearning.org/partner-form) to learn more.
