Before you run your Professional Development program, be sure to look through the facilitator materials. These are the materials you will use during your program to help walk you and your participants through each activity. The <strong>Facilitator Guide</strong> is a step-by-step walkthrough that explain each activity and their scheduled time. The <strong>Facilitator Slidedeck</strong> provides live instructions and visual prompts for the group while you are running the program.

As an additional resource when you are running your program, we have created a slidedeck full of prompts, participant instructions, and materials. The "Learn & Earn PD101" program is designed to run without slides, but this deck may be useful for certain locations depending on the size of their group and other variables.
